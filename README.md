# logs_to_csv

This project was made for 1 logs file. You can easily adapt it to your need:
1- Change 'inventorylocation' by the term that will help you identify the lines you need to take, and only these ones
2- If your datas are separated by something else than ',' then change delimiter line 6
3- Change rows you need and their order in line 10

And if you are brave enough, make it modular with a user interface ;-)
